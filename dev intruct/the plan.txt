I. Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive, phased development plan for the 4-Score Fitness application, specifically targeting Android as the primary mobile platform. Built using React Native and Expo, the architecture allows for potential future expansion to iOS, but the initial development, testing, and deployment efforts will prioritize the Android experience.

This plan is designed to provide a clear, structured, and upfront overview of the entire project, addressing the need for a non-iterative workflow suitable for development leveraging an AI coding assistant, particularly considering the challenges associated with Broca's Aphasia (BAA) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).

The plan encompasses project setup, core architecture, feature implementation across the F.O.U.R. pillars (Forge, Optimize, Unite, Recover), integration of supporting features and external services, and finalization steps. Crucially, it incorporates detailed, granular prompts intended for an AI coding assistant at each stage, tailored for building the Android application. These prompts are designed to be verbose, specific, and complete, guiding the AI through component creation, logic implementation, and the integration of specified tools and libraries according to the project's defined technology stack and Code Descriptor system.

The objective is to provide a holistic roadmap, enabling a predictable development process by mapping out the entire application flow, required file structures, and necessary modifications from the outset, with a clear focus on delivering a high-quality Android application first.

II. Preliminary Planning & Overview
(Goal): Establish a clear overview of the application's structure, dependencies, and the mapping between design elements and development phases, focusing on the Android target.

(Sections II.A. Core Project Tenets, II.B. Wireframe to Development Phase Mapping, and II.C. External Tool Integration Summary remain the same as they outline the overall structure and tool usage applicable to the React Native project, but will be interpreted with an Android-first lens during implementation.)

Key Consideration: While libraries like Victory Native  and React Navigation are cross-platform, testing and UI adjustments will prioritize Android devices and emulators.   

III. Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture (Android Focus)
(Goal): Establish the foundational elements of the Android application, including the project structure, core dependencies, navigation, and basic authentication flow, optimized for Android deployment.

1.1 React Native Project Initialization (Expo Preferred)

AI Prompt:
AI, provide step-by-step instructions and code snippets to integrate Firebase into the initialized Expo React Native project ('4ScoreApp').

Detail the steps to create a new project in the Firebase console.
Explain which Firebase services need to be enabled: Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-In), Firestore (Native mode), Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions (Node.js runtime, specify latest stable LTS), and Hosting.
Provide instructions for adding an Android app to the Firebase project within the console settings, including obtaining the necessary google-services.json configuration file. Also, add an iOS app placeholder for future compatibility, obtaining GoogleService-Info.plist. Prioritize the Android setup.
Show how to install the required Firebase JavaScript SDK packages (firebase, specifically @react-native-firebase/app, @react-native-firebase/auth, @react-native-firebase/firestore, @react-native-firebase/storage, @react-native-firebase/functions if using the RNFirebase library, or the modular Web SDK firebase/app, firebase/auth, firebase/firestore, etc., if preferred with Expo). Clarify compatibility with Expo Go vs Development Builds if using RNFirebase.   
Generate a configuration file (e.g., src/services/firebaseConfig.ts) to initialize Firebase within the app using the configuration keys obtained from the Firebase console (web config keys). Use placeholder values for the actual keys.
Create placeholder environment variable files (e.g., .env.development, .env.production) and demonstrate how to load the Firebase configuration keys from these files (using a library like react-native-dotenv or Expo's built-in system) into the firebaseConfig.ts file, ensuring keys are not hardcoded.
1.3 Local Development Environment Setup (Firebase Emulators & Android Emulator)
